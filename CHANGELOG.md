## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-18

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete rewrite of theme generation algorithm based on Eidolon Root theme analysis
- **BREAKING**: File naming changed from `{package-name}-color-theme.json` to `{name}-theme.json`
- **Algorithm**: Complete overhaul to use direct palette color mapping instead of complex derivations
- **Color Mapping**: Fixed editor background to use `palette[0]` (color0) instead of background color
- **Background Hierarchy**: Activity/Sidebar/Status now use actual background color, Editor/Panel/Terminal use palette[0]

### Added  
- **650+ VS Code Color Properties**: Comprehensive coverage of all VS Code UI elements
- **Enhanced Token Colors**: Direct palette mapping with proper scope assignments:
  - Comments: palette[8] (brightBlack) with italic
  - Keywords: palette[10] (brightGreen)  
  - Strings: palette[1] (red)
  - Functions: palette[12] (brightBlue)
  - Classes: palette[5] (magenta)
  - Numbers: palette[9] (brightRed)
  - Operators: palette[6] (cyan)
  - Tags: palette[11] (brightYellow)
- **JSON Rainbow Colors**: 9-level color cycling for nested JSON structures
- **Special Case Handling**: `root.txt` â†’ `eidolon-root` theme name resolution
- **Opacity Helper**: Consistent `withOpacity()` function for all transparency effects

### Fixed
- **Color Accuracy**: Themes now generate with palette-first approach matching professional themes
- **Semantic Colors**: Consistent error=red, warning=yellow, success=green, info=blue mapping
- **UI Consistency**: All VS Code interface elements properly styled with appropriate colors
- **Opacity Calculations**: Standardized opacity values (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%) throughout
- **Background Variants**: Proper calculated variants (widgets, inputs) based on palette[0]

### Technical  
- **Performance**: Removed complex color derivation functions for direct palette access
- **Maintainability**: Simplified codebase with clearer color mapping logic
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript errors resolved with proper type definitions

## [1.0.2] - 2024-08-13
